🛠 Features:
✅ Data Collection & Preprocessing – Extracts news data from social media, forums, and news sites, cleans text, and tokenizes it.
✅ Fake News Classification – Uses DziriBERT & Transformers to classify text as real, or fake.
✅ Source Verification – Cross-references sources with verified databases to detect inconsistencies.
✅ Interactive Dashboard – Allows users to analyze text, report fake news, and visualize fake news trends.
