🚀 Fake News Detection in Arabic is an AI-powered system designed to identify and analyze fake news in Arabic text. Using Deep Learning (AraBERT, Transformers) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system detects unreliable information based on linguistic patterns, sources, and online spread.

🛠 Features:
✅ Data Collection & Preprocessing – Extracts news data from social media, forums, and news sites, cleans text, and tokenizes it.
✅ Fake News Classification – Uses AraBERT & Transformers to classify text as real, doubtful, or fake.
✅ Source Verification – Cross-references sources with verified databases to detect inconsistencies.
✅ Interactive Dashboard – Allows users to analyze text, report fake news, and visualize fake news trends.
